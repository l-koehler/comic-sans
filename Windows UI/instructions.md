#### Windows UI

this changes a bunch of stuff because this basically changes the  
"default UI font", which some programs use for their UI.
this also breaks some "symbol fonts".
in general, this is a bad idea.  

**Most UI stuff**  
* Right-click the "ChangeFonts.reg" file  
* Select "Merge"  
* Click on yes/ok if you are asked to confirm/allow something.
